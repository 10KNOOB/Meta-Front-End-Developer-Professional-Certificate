### In your code, you have a value that is stored as `18 > 27`. If you use the typeof operator on this value, which one of these outcomes would the console return?

- [x] Boolean <br>
      Correct! When you compare two numbers using the comparison operator, the return value is either true or false - and the typeof returns 'Boolean' as the underlying data type.
- [ ] String
- [ ] Number
- [ ] BigInt
