### You have written the following code:

```
var myNum = Math.ceil(2.49);
console.log(myNum);
```

When you run this code, what value will be returned?

- [x] 3. <br>
     That's right! The `ceil()` method only rounds upwards to the nearest whole number, which is 3 in this case.
- [ ] 2.49.
- [ ] 2.
- [ ] Error.
