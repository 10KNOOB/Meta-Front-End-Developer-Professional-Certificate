### You have written the following code:

```
var myNum = Math.ceil(2.49);
console.log(myNum);
```

When you run this code, what value will be returned? Select the correct answer below:

- [x] 3 <br>
      That's right! The `ceil()` method only rounds upwards to the nearest whole number, which is 3 in this case.
- [ ] 2.49
- [ ] 2
- [ ] Error
