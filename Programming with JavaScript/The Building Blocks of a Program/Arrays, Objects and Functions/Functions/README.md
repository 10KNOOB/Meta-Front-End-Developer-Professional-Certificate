### You are creating a function and write the following code:

```
function hello() {
  console.log(“Hello world”);
}
```

How do you call your function in your code?

- [ ] `hello;`
- [x] `hello();` <br>
      Correct. In JavaScript, you can call a function by typing the function name followed by the open and close parentheses.
- [ ] `hello(){}`
