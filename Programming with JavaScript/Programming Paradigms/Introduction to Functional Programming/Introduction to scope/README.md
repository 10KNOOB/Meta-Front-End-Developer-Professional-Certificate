### You decide to create a variable within the local scope while scripting a new JavaScript file. Is this variable accessible to code at the global scope level?

- [ ] Yes.
- [x] No. <br>
      Correct. Variables created within the local scope cannot be read by code at the global scope level. They are accessible only to functions located within the local scope.
