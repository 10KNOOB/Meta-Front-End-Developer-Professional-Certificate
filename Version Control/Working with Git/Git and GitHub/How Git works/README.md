### You are working on a project and have to share some code with a colleague. What is the correct order the code will flow in Git workflow?

- [ ] Working directory, committed files, staging area, remote repository.
- [ ] Remote repository, working directory, staging area, committed files.
- [x] Working directory, staging area, committed files, remote repository. <br>
      That's correct! The correct workflow is from the working directory to the staging area, then to committed files, remote repository and lastly to your colleague.
- [ ] Staging area, committed files, remote repository, working directory.
