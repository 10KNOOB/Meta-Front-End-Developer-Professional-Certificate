### You have a text file that contains addresses. You would like to search for addresses with the word “Ocean”, so you perform a grep search with no additional flags. In this case, which one of the following statements would be true?

- [ ] The search returns partial matches.
- [x] The search returns results that begin with Ocean. <br>
      That's correct! Because this search is case sensitive, it would only return words that begin with “Ocean”.
- [ ] The search returns results that begin with Ocean or ocean.
- [ ] None of these statements apply.
