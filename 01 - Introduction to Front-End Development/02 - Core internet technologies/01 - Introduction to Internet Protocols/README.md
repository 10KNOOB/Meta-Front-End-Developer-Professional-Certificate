### Is the following statement true or false? The payload part of IP packets supports multiple protocols to make sure that information arrives as expected. Two of these are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). UDP is used to send data that must arrive correctly and in order.

- [ ] True
- [x] False <br>
      That is correct! TCP is used for data that must arrive correctly and in order. This is because TCP can deal with data packets arriving out of order, becoming damaged or corrupted, or dropped or lost albeit at the cost of a small delay.
