### What are the two props you need to add when creating a controlled range component?

- [ ] `min` and `max`
- [ ] `range` and `max`
- [ ] `htmlFor` and `id`
- [x] `value` and `onChange` <br>
      That's correct. The `value` prop is used to hook the local state up and `onChange` prop is used to receive the changes and update the state accordingly.
