### Imagine you’d like to better control the submission of a form you’re creating for an app. ​Which prop is required to prevent the default behavior of the form submit event in React?

- [x] `preventDefault` <br>
      That’s correct. To avoid the default form behavior of submitting in React, you must use the event property and call `preventDefault`.
- [ ] `onSubmit`
- [ ] `onChange`
- [ ] `value`
