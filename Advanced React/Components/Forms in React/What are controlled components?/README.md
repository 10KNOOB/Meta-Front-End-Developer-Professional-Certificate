### You are using controlled components in React in order to have more control over the forms in an application you are creating. ​Which of the following props is used to perform state delegation?

- [ ] `onSubmit`.
- [ ] `onChange`.
- [x] `value`. <br>
      That’s correct. State delegation is performed via the `value` prop. A combination of local state and the `value` prop is needed to create a controlled component.
