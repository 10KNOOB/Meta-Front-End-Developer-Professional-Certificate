- [ ] To access the needed properties from the initial data.
- [ ] To store the result of the transformation being performed.
- [x] To access the content of the variable that represents your list item. <br>
      Thatâ€™s correct. When a JSX transformation will be part of the render method of components, you need to use curly braces to wrap your dynamic data so it can be accessed.
- [ ] To loop through the array of initial data.
