### You want to add an image to your webpage. What should you add within the image tag? Please select all that apply.

- [x] The link to the source file <br>
      That’s correct! Just like when linking to a file, you need to provide the link to the image. The code will be `<img src= "example.jpg" width="100" height="100" />`
- [x] The alt description <br>
      That’s correct! Adding alt descriptions is not required to add an image on your website but it is certainly best practice. This is helpful when the image becomes unavailable, for instance, if the image file is accidentally deleted. But, most importantly, it improves the accessibility of your website to those who are differently abled. Screen readers and other accessibility tools use the Alt attribute to provide information to their users.
- [ ] The href attribute
- [x] The width and height specifications <br>
      That’s correct! The image will display at its actual size if you do not specify the dimensions in the img tag. The code will be `<img src= "example.jpg" width="100" height="100" />`
