### If I want to notify clients that Little Lemon has added a new burger to their menu. To do this I will use a Bootstrap Component. Which CSS classes can I use?

- [x] alert-info. <br>
      That is correct! The alert-info is a modifier CSS class to style the alert component.
- [x] alert. <br>
      That is correct! The alert CSS class will style an element as an alert component.
- [ ] card.
